# TwitSplit App

The product Tweeter allows users to post short messages limited to 50 characters
each.
Sometimes, users get excited and write messages longer than 50 characters.
Instead of rejecting these messages, we would like to add a new feature that will split the
message into parts and send multiple messages on the user's behalf,
all of them meeting the 50 character requirement.
